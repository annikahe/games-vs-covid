# games-vs-covid
Working repository for the workshop Net-COVID http://www.combine.umd.edu/network-epidemiology/

In this project, we want to explore game theoretical approaches towards the development of epidemics.
In particular, we are interested in modeling how adherence to social distancing effects epidemics using an agent-based social-distancing game on a network.
